# Hardcore Difficulty Mod for Red Dead Redemption 2 

The goal of this mod is to provide an experience that is more challenging and satisfying than the vanilla Red Dead Redemption 2 game.
We accomplish this by modifying several in game values such as the damage taken, damage dealt, health regeneration and more.
Updates with more mechanic alterations are to come soon. See the bottom of this page for planned features.

## Installation
1. Download [RAGE Plugin Hook](http://ragepluginhook.net/Downloads.aspx) for RDR2
2. Extract the contents into your game directory, where RDR2.exe is
3. Create a folder in the game directory called C#Plugins
4. Extract HardcoreMod.dll and place it into C#Plugins
5. Launch RDR2 and load into Story mode
6. Run RAGEPluginHook.exe from the game directory

If the mod loaded successfully, you will see it notified in the top left corner of the game.

### You can hit F2 to toggle the mod on and off.

**In order for the hook to work, make sure you have overlays such as FRAPS and Rivatuner disabled.**

To update, replace the DLL in C#Plugins.

## Planned Features
- Lowered maximum ammo
- Ammo drops must be looted from bodies, instead of simply walking over them
- Dead Eye is just slow motion, no marking, resembling Level 1 Dead Eye in RDR1
- Health and Stamina Cores deplete faster

There's just a few here, but not all intended features may be possible, as we are working within the limits of the game engine.
