# Hardcore Difficulty Mod for Red Dead Redemption 2

## Featured on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/135)
The goal of this mod is to provide an experience that is more challenging and satisfying than vanilla Red Dead Redemption 2.
We accomplish this currently by modifying the damage taken, damage dealt, and health regeneration.
Updates with more mechanics and interesting modifications are soon to come.

## Planned Features
- Lowered maximum ammo
- Ammo drops must be looted from bodies, instead of simply walking over them
- Health and Stamina Cores deplete faster
- No bullet trails
