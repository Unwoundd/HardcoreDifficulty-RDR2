# Hardcore Difficulty Mod for Red Dead Redemption 2 

## [Featured on NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/135)
The goal of this mod is to provide an experience that is more challenging and satisfying than the vanilla Red Dead Redemption 2 game.
We accomplish this currently by modifying the damage taken, damage dealt, and health regeneration.
Updates with more mechanics and interesting modifications are soon to come.

## Installation
1. Download [RAGE Plugin Hook](http://ragepluginhook.net/Downloads.aspx) for RDR2
2. Extract the contents into your game directory, where RDR2.exe is
3. Create a folder in the game directory called C#Plugins
4. Extract HardcoreDiff.dll and place it into C#Plugins
5. Launch RDR2
6. Run RAGEPluginHook.exe from the game directory

If the mod loaded successfully, you will see it notified in the top left corner of the game.

### You can hit F2 to toggle the mod on and off.

**In order for the hook to work, make sure you have overlays such as FRAPS and RivaTuner disabled.**

To update, replace the DLL in C#Plugins.

## Planned Features
- Lowered maximum ammo
- Ammo drops must be looted from bodies, instead of simply walking over them
- Health and Stamina Cores deplete faster
- No bullet trails
